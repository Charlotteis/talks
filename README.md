### Talks I've Given

**When is a Zombie not a Zombie?**

[_Proof_](http://lanyrd.com/2013/geekynight-june/)

_About_: This was a five minute lightning talk on the different types of zombie that we seen in media today, from the very obvious to the almost human.

_Would I give this talk again?_: Probably not, mainly because it was such a long time ago that I've forgotten half of the content. **However** I'd love to give another Zombie talk in the future, I just need to write one.

### Talks I'd like to give

**I'm gonna be a developer**

_About_: A short-ish talk loosely based on [this post](https://ccharlottespencer.wordpress.com/2014/09/04/im-gonna-be-a-developer/) I wrote. With added bits about what I've been up to since writing that post, the support of the web community and tips and tricks I have gathered.
